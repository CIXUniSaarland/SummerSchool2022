    "What do people do with a sequence of observations (visual or otherwise)? Should they just use the most recent observation? Or perhaps the \"best\" observation? In fact, people do neither. Multiple sources of evidence suggests that people optimally integrate observations to generate a posterior estimate given all of the available information. One way to model this process is with Bayesian inference.\n",

    "If $\\sigma_{z_1}$ were equal to $\\sigma_{z_2}$, which is to say that the prior and observation are of equal precision, then the equation says the optimal estimate of position is simply the average of the two measurements, as would be expected. On the other hand, if $\\sigma_{z_1}$ were larger than $\\sigma_{z_2}$, which is to say that the uncertainty in the prior $z_1$ is greater than that of the observation $z_2$ , then the equation dictates “weighting” $z2$ more heavily than $z1$. Finally, the variance of the estimate is less than $\\sigma_{z_1}$ , even if $\\sigma_{z_2}$ is very large: even poor quality data provide some information, and should thus increase the precision of the user's estimate."
