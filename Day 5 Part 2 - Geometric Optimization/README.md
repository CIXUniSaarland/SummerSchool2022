# A primer on Geometric Optimization

Since this is in C++, I created another repository to connect all dependencies, etc.

**Find all instructions here: https://github.com/alexiiion/teach-geometric-optimization**

Please install all components (editor, compiler, Boost libs, CMake) **by Wednesday.** The software (e.g. IDE) are large and take space and time to install. When ready, test the `0_compilation_test` binary.
