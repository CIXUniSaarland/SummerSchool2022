Even if I have an excellent model of people's heights, any given person's height won't be precisely predicted by that model.\n",

We can just add uncertainty as \"goop\" to soak up the variation between the truth and the model; we *pretend* that there is randomness to mask the misalignment. If done correctly, our inferences are still correct, and *represent* the degree to which they have misfit reality.\n",

    "Optimisation: there are various different strategies. Techniques like automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) are a fairly general way to apply variational inference to arbitrary problems, but are limited in the kinds of distribution that can be represented.\n",

    "#### Pros and cons\n",
    "* Advantages: Often very fast, especially compared to MCMC; covers the whole sample space instantly.\n",
    "* Disadvantages: Requires specific derivation for a given problem (though may be able to use automatic differentiation to help); may have consistent error that will never be resolved by additional computation\n"
