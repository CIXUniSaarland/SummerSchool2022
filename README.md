# 6th Computational Interaction Summer School 2022 - 

The 6th Summer School on Computational Interaction will be held at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany. It takes place between the 13th June and the 18th June 2022 (Monday through Saturday) and is organized by the Saarland Informatics Campus and the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics.

This summer school teaches HCI students, researchers, and industry professionals computational methods and their application in user interface design, interactive systems, user modeling, and more. Each day features one or two outstanding researchers who share their expertise on a technical topic and advice attendants in practical hands-on sessions — always in relevance to HCI.

For the first time this year, on the last day, attendants will get the chance to develop entrepreneurial skills and learn how to translate their research expertise into business ideas and ventures.

Themes & Topics
We have put together a remarkable program that features the leading experts in the area of computational interaction. Each day is dedicated to a specific topic and will be divided into theoretical background lectures and practical hands-on exercises. For each topic there will be extensive opportunities to practice the acquired knowledge and to get feedback from the instructors.
