However, this is by no means an optimized version; here, we are happy to tradeoff performance for even a smallest gain in clarity. Also note that this notebook is <strong>not</strong> the full implementation of GAN Explorer from that paper. To implement the full web-based tool would require placing the code from this notebook onto a Webserver, connecting it with a database that will permantenly store the data for each individual user, and implementing client side user interface.\n",
